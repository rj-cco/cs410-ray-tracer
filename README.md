# cs410-ray-tracer

This project is my personal favorite. It is a ray tracer for producing complex static scenes based on file input. It can render spherical objects and objects made out of triangles.

This project was extremely beneficial in practicing Object Oriented Programming as almost every component of the ray tracer exists in a class as an object within the code. All code was written in C++, and the external library Eigen was used for assisting in the complex linear algebra required for calculations.

The input files describing the components of the scenes are in this repo, as well as the final renderings of the scenes as .ppm files.
