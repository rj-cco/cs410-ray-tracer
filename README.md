# cs410-ray-tracer

This project is my personal favorite. It is a ray tracer for producing complex static scenes based on file input. It can render spherical objects and objects made out of triangles.

This project was extremely beneficial in practicing Object Oriented Programming as almost every component of the ray tracer exists as a class and an object within the code. All code was written in C++, and the external library Eigen was used for assisting in the complex linear algebra required.

The final renderings are available as .ppm files in this repo.
